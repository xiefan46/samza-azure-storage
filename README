1. Overview


This project is used to test the performance of Azure disk.

Summary of the project is in: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c4RRzx53GhNdbWA9uZmlBSFVofOPI23fq1ZokF6Pun4/edit?usp=sharing


2. Project Structure
The milestone1/ directory contains code of evaluation of milestone 1 described in my document, and it's mainly used for
feasibility analysis. Milestone 1 evaluate the basic behaviour such as disk mount, unmount, clone latencies.

The milestone2/ directory contains code of performance benchmark. milestone2/fio_benchmark.ipynb evaluate the azure disk
performance by using FIO tool. milestone2/rocksdb_benchmark.ipynb evaluate disk performance by using the db_bench tool
provide by rocksdb community.

The scripts/ directory contains several util shell script such as mount a disk and copy result files.

The milestone2/library/ directory contains several useful classes that can be used by Juypter Notebook.

The results/ directory contains the results of my previous experiments:
    (a) results/fio_result/ contains the results of fio_benchmark
    (b) results/rocks_db_benchmark_result3_no_compression/ and results/rocks_db_benchmark_result4_with_compression/
         contains the results of rocksdb benchmark

3. How to run

3.1 Create VM and disks
Firstly, you need to create a VM in Azure and attach disks to that VM. And you also need to go to the Azure portal to
get the public IP address of this VM

3.2 Clone the project and install necessary libraries

(a) ssh to the vm

(b) clone the project
git clone https://github.com/xiefan46/samza-azure-storage.git

(c) setup the environment
  (c1) The scripts/setup_envir.sh can be used for setup the environment. This scripts will download and
  install rocksdb and many other libraries. Notice that it will overwrite the benchmark.sh script in rocksdb
  by our own script.
  (c2) Mount your disk. You can use scripts/mount_disk.sh script to mount a disk and a file system


3.3 Connect to remote Jupyter Notebook
The reason why I use Juypter Notebook is that it can explore the results interactively. You can connect to a remote VM
and run different benchmarks on it and visualized the results in the Juypter Notebook very easily.

The tutorial of connection to remote jupyter notebook can be found here:

3.4 After that, you can run your tests in your local machine's browser.
